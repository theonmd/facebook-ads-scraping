# Facebook Ads Scraping

The goal of this project is:

1. Find all the pages on Facebook dealing with a specific topic by scraping Facebook
2. Scrape all the ads published by these pages on the Facebook Ad Librabry
3. Store everything in a DataFrame

You'll need a Facebook account to do so, you can either use yours or create one for this task. In the code, replace the following fields with your login info:
```
login = '...'
password = '...'
```

The main libraries used are Selenium and BeautifulSoup. This project was strongly inspired by this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@mackgrenfell/fixing-the-facebook-ad-library-part-i-scraping-can-save-it-6b737d04614c).
